# AI Open Book

This is an [OpenBook](OpenBook.md) on artificial intelligence and deep learning compiled with an amalgamation of various advanced AI concepts presented in more simple to understand terms with more everyday life scenarios.

## Background & Motivation

Most of the AI books in the market focus on the theoretical concepts of the AI at academic level. Advanced one go into the depth of mathematically models which are not so easy to understand for people with lighter mathematics knowledge. Very few of them focus on the practical aspects of the AI implementation. 

Practical AI bridges the gap by focusing on the latest advancements of AI and mapping them to the practical implementation scenarios with use cases thereby taking AI out of academics and labs (of few startup or blue chip firms) to a wider industry. At every stage proper care is been taken in mapping the AI concepts to the advancements in other digital technologies as appropriate

From novices to professionals, this book is a good to read as it covers the topics by complexity, implementations and samples 

This book is published as an Open Book. Open book concept follows the model of OpenSource software development where book is available for the community based on OpenSource license models. 

Initially when i started writing this book, I always wanted to add something to make proper justice to the topic which was not positively received by the publisher due to publications standards and timelines. Then I came up with the idea of self publishing it as an eBook which later converted to an Open Book. 

As an open book it does not have the standard publication limitation of the chapter and pages. Book effectively exploits that benefit and takes each subject from the basic concepts to practical applications or use cases to implementation scenarios and in some cases even to the development of sample models and code modules. As an open book this is constantly getting review, refined and augmented. More and more pages are being added every day.
