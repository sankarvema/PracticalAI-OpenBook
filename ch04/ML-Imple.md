# ML Implementation

## Model development

In short model development can be summarized to

- You studied the data.
- You selected a model.
- You trained it on the training data (i.e., the learning algorithm searched for the model parameter values that minimize a cost function).
- Finally, you applied the model to make predictions on new cases (this is called inference), hoping that this model will generalize well.
